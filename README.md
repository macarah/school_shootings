# About
This visualization was created as a project for [CS441: Data Visualization](https://emilywall.github.io/vis/) in which I focus on the topic of the history of school shootings in the United States. I received feedback and guidance from Instructor: Dr. Emily Wall, Artist: W.J. Lofton, and TA: Thomas Davidson.

In my poem, "Have we forgotten," I am focusing on the social justice issue of gun violence in America with an emphasis on school shootings, and the lack of action taken to protect the lives of our children. Additionally, I wanted to point out that until it is someone that they know who has died by a bullet, many Americans can separate themselves from the issue and tend to sympathize from a distance, eventually forgetting the importance of the lives that were lost. Because of this, I have created visualizations that appeal to logos, pathos, and ethos.
